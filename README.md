Python scripts and QuickUSB drivers (qusb_acq, qusb_fft, etc.)

(04/28/2014)
The contents of this repository are:

1. pippin_ggse.tar.gz
   --this is the /usr/ggse/ directory on pippin, including rxdsp_acq_2.0.py
2. qusb_pippin.tar.gz
   --this is the /usr/src/qusb_acq/ directory on Pippin, which includes (most importantly)
      the program qusb_acq as well as source code
3. QuickUsbLinux_v2.15.0-Prerelease_110721.tar.gz
   --This is the version of the QuickUSB drivers obtained by Matt (and Micah) for which they
      had to sign a nondisclosure agreement some time ago. They are known to work with the
      programs above, so they are here despite being possibly outdated.
4. QuickUsbLibrary_v2.15.2_Linux.tar.gz
   --These are the most recent drivers that I (Spencer Hatch) obtained from Bitwise Systems
      in April 2014.
